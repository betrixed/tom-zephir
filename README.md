PHP and TOML
============

This zephir version of toml parser is based on Yosymfony/Toml.

This compiled extension uses namespace Toml.

The php interpreted-only version that performs much the same
with the same php-unit test rig error messages is at [Betrixed/Toml](https://github.com/betrixed/toml)

The zephir version is a bit faster than the interpreted PHP. How much faster will depend on the test benchmark method.

On PHP 7.2 the newly vamped interpreter speed is hard to improve on.
